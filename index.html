<br>Pedri plays with calm and clarity, always thinking a step ahead.
His movement is smooth, his passing sharp — everything feels effortless.
He’s the kind of player who makes the game look simple, even when it’s not.
Under pressure, he stays cool and finds space where no one else can.
Quiet on the surface, but always in control.</p>
